        <h1>The Best Poutine You'll Ever Have</h1>
        <p>Poutine, a Canadian classic. McDonalds poutine is the best but for the DIY folks out there, this one's for you. Perfect for cold days and Instagram.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 quart vegetable oil for frying</li>
            <li>1 (10.25 ounce) can beef gravy</li>
            <li>5 medium potatoes, cut into fries</li>
            <li>2 cups cheese curds</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat oil in a deep fryer or deep heavy skillet to 365 degrees F (185 degrees C). While the oil is heating, you can begin to warm your gravy. </li>
            <li>Place the fries into the hot oil, and cook until light brown, about 5 minutes. Make the fries in batches if necessary to allow them room to move a little in the oil. Remove to a paper towel lined plate to drain.</li>
            <li>Place the fries on a serving platter, and sprinkle the cheese over them. Ladle gravy over the fries and cheese, and serve immediately.</li>
        </ol>
